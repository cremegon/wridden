# Wridden Prototyping and Design Process

What we wanted to achieve from this project was a seemless creative application. While the main idea of the project is focused around writing stories, it
is also concerned with more creative abilities such as being able to draw, create character profiles, link drawings and profiles together as well as 
design a community page where users can directly share, read and interact with one another. 

Additionally, the flow of the app was kept carefuly in mind as to not break or be cumbersome to the user. Ideally, the design should be so intuitive that users
such as children should be able to pick it up without fault, while also aligning features that can be used by experienced users such as hobbyists and professionals! 

The shape language and ergonomics of interacting with the buttons, modals and images was also kept closely in mind, as to not exceed the range of the thumb's movement
as well as the intuitive dexterity of using fingers for extra features such as settings and dropdowns. 

The app would allow community events such as "Prompt of the Day" to encourage writers to write their pieces and overcome writer blocks. They could then share 
these stories and be featured on rotation for users to explore the community and connect with one another.

### Color Theme Selection: 

The final theme for the app is a simple combination of grey and orange, because we wanted the app not to stand out too much and be easier on the eyes.
Upon research on colours that are most prefereable for reading, writing and amongst writers, it was found that less saturated colours and lesser contrast is
most preferable between writing enthusiasts, as the process is lengthy, eye health must be taken care of at all times.
