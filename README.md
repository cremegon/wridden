# Wridden Prototyping and Design Process

What we wanted to achieve from this project was a seemless creative application. While the main idea of the project is focused around writing stories, it
is also concerned with more creative abilities such as being able to draw, create character profiles, link drawings and profiles together as well as 
design a community page where users can directly share, read and interact with one another. 

Additionally, the flow of the app was kept carefuly in mind as to not break or be cumbersome to the user. Ideally, the design should be so intuitive that users
such as children should be able to pick it up without fault, while also aligning features that can be used by experienced users such as hobbyists and professionals!
